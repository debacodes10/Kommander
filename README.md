## What is Kommander?

Setting up development environments and managing system configurations often involves searching for obscure commands and stitching together scripts from various sources. This process is slow, error-prone, and frustrating.

**Kommander** aims to solve this by providing an AI-powered interface directly in your terminal. Simply tell `kom` what you want to do in plain English, and it will generate the necessary shell commands for you.

## Core Principles

* **Open Source:** Built in the open, for the community. We believe in transparency and collaboration.
* **Safety First:** AI-generated commands are never executed automatically. You always have the final say, with a clear prompt to execute, copy, or abort.
* **Works With Your Terminal:** Kommander is not a replacement for your favorite terminal. It's a universal tool designed to work inside any shell, on any modern Linux distribution.
